Automatic Differentiation [autodiff]
=========================

<div class=issue>
This chapter needs to specify:



* The built-in types and attributes related to automatic differentiation.
* The rules applied when checking the body of a `[Differentiable]` function.
* The semantics of the `fwd_diff` and `bwd_diff` operators, including how to determine the signature of the function they return.
* The requirements of the `IDifferentiable` interface, and also the rules used to automatically synthesize conformance for it.
